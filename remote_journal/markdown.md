# Remote journal
Or how I learned to work in a pijiama


## How many are working remotely?


## How many are doing a daily meeting with a video call?


## How many find it useful?



## The Goal
* Proposing an alternative and some argumentation for replacing remote daily
* Tickling your imagination



Work with eXtreme Programming for 8 years

The daily stand-up was never a chore (and I actually liked it)

Note: clarify how XP works




* It's good for synching up with the other team members
* It's useful for deciding the pairs before starting the day
* It helps in checking the team's pulse

Note: for example we can avoid having two people working on the same thing or solving the same problem twice



Then the pandemic came and the daily became remote
* Video call
* Daily event in a calendar
* You know the rest...

Note: Everyone had his own little box in a video call and our usual appointment



### Partly it felt useless...
* Communication already happened on Slack, before and after the daily
* People weren't really sharing, they were just saying SOMETHING
* Communication without connection



### ...and partly it felt punishing
* We had often to wait for someone who wasn't on time
* Sometimes it was too long, sometimes too short (and we discussed it during retro)
* People often weren't really paying attention
* Flow had to be interrupted for attending

Note: why not dropping it completely?

In a remote organization, the need for communication and synchronization is even more important
* Communication is more structured and knowledge needs to be organized better
* People tend to feel isolated
* People have their own habits and timing



Working remotely and asynchronous communication is like P&J

Note: remote work and asynchronous communication is like peanut butter and jelly



## Introducing the Remote Journal



A shared document that the team members compile daily, sometime in the morning
* Everyone gives a brief description of what happened yesterday
* What will do today
* Any blocker or anything else might pass by their mind

## Cool because
* Doesn't interrupt the flow
* Can be read anytime, even by people who cannot attend the daily
* Can be written anytime in the morning, respecting individuals' needs

Note: but there are also some advantages over a simple chat channel



## Even cooler because
* Can be backtracked, even months before
    * Helps with retrospectives
    * Helps with recovering info in the future
* Can be searched
* Can be shared with anyone



### Wrapping up
* Improvement of work happiness and satisfaction of the team.
* Hopefully I've inspired some of you to look for some other recurring meeting/ceremony that is waiting to be converted into asynchronous
